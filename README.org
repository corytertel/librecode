* Librecode
A derivative of Liberation Serif for programming.
Intended for those who like variable width serif fonts and wish to program in them.

Changes include:
- Widened space for indentation.
- Centered hyphen for arrows and arithmetic.
- Centered asterisk for arithmetic and increased visual impact.
* TODO
- Possibly decrease space width to be more consistent with the rest of the font
- Nerd font icons
- Make parenthesis, brackets, and braces more noticeable
